# Tawny

> Self-hosted application platform for solo developers and small teams who don't want the overhead of a full
> kubernetes cluster

## Overview

Tawny is an open-source alternative to Render and Heroku. Self-hosting is the primary use-case.

Run you applications from a simple dockerfile or a full kubernetes manifest. Free TLS from Let's Encrypt ensures
your externally exposed applications are secure from the get go. 

It lets you manage deployments of applications and databases without the overhead of a full-blown kubernetes
cluster yet gives you the flexibility to take more control if you need it.

Management can be done from the user interface, CLI, SSH or via the API. All you need is access to a VPS, RaspberryPi or
virtual machine to get started.
